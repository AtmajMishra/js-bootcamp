// Elementary rules for Language specification
/* 

    1.Texts:-
        case sensitive:
            i.e var number, var Number, var nUMber, var numbER all are different
        variable declaration:
            
            declaring a variable has certain rules
            variable name cannot start with number 
            Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
            Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
            Names must begin with a letter
            Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)
            Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names


    2.Literals:-
        2322
        23.3
        null
        true 
        false
        ....

    3. Reserved keywords:-
        let
        if
        for
        return
        enum
        implements
        interface
        private
        package
